#According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times.

class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:

        left, right = 0, len(citations)
        
        while(left<=right):
            mid = (left+right) // 2
            l = 0
            r = len(citations) - 1

            while(l<=r):
                m = (l+r) // 2
                if citations[m] >= mid:
                    r = m - 1
                else:
                    l = m + 1
            paper_at_least_x = len(citations) - l
            #print(mid,paper_at_least_x)

            if mid == paper_at_least_x:
                return mid
            elif mid > paper_at_least_x:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
            
        return right
